## [5.0.4] - 2024-07-15

## [5.0.3] - 2024-07-10
### Fixed

## [5.0.2] - 2024-07-05

## [5.0.1] - 2024-03-27
### Changed
- make user-agent headers more descriptive (#168)

### Fixed
- make client more resilient to non-conforming responses from `unleash-edge` (#162)
  - while the unleash server provides always valid responses, (at least some versions of) unleash-edge can provide an unexpected JSON response (null instead of empty array).
  - fixed the handling of the response, so we do not throw exceptions in this situation.

## [5.0.0] - 2023-10-30
### Added
- change seed for variantutils to ensure fair distribution (#160)
  - client specification is [here](https://github.com/Unleash/client-specification/tree/v5.0.2/specifications)
  - A new seed is introduced to ensure a fair distribution for variants, addressing the issue of skewed variant distribution due to using the same hash string for both gradual rollout and variant allocation.

## [4.6.0] - 2023-10-16
### Added
- dependant toggles (#155)
  - client specification is [here](https://github.com/Unleash/client-specification/pull/63)

### Added
- Add Context#to_h method (#136)

### Fixed
- Bootstrapped variants now work when client is disabled (#138)
